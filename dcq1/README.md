# Question 1: Factorials

The factorial of a number is a multiple of all integers between 1 and that number inclusive. For example, the
factorial of 5 (expressed as 5!) would be 5x4x3x2x1 = 120.

Write a program that calculates the factorial of each input value.

## Input data

The input will consist of a series of positive integers between 1 and 15 inclusive, each on a line by itself. The end
of the input data file will be signified by a line with a # mark as the first character.

## Output data

You should output, one answer per line, the factorial of each given number, in the format shown in the sample output
below.

## Sample input

* 1
* 4
* 3
* #

## Sample output

* 1
* 24
* 6
