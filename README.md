# The Register's IBM Bluemix Programming Competition 2015

[The Register](http://www.theregister.co.uk) held a
[programming competition](http://www.theregister.co.uk/Design/page/hub/ibm/) and
[I won it](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/08/27/ibm_bluemix_programming_competition_resuts/)
gaining a massive 55" 4K TV in the process. Nice!

This entry ran correctly in the fastest time when deployed to IBM's Bluemix Cloud Foundry service.

### Subdirectories

The solutions to the three programming problems are in the `dcq1`, `dcq2` and `dcq3` directories.

All are implemented as Java JAX-RS services (the competition required a single source file
for each problem and JAX-RS was an easy way of achieving that).

I also wrote a small Node application to check how quickly the solutions ran (that could also be
deployed to Bluemix). This is in the `dcqm` directory.
